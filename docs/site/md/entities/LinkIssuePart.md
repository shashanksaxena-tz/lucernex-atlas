# LinkIssuePart

*13 fields · module: Capital Projects & Scheduling · Postgres: `link_issue_part`*

Not covered by the Data Fields catalogue: this record type appears in the 223-object census but has no row in the catalogue of 6,158 configurable fields, so no document describes the record as a whole. What is known is structural — 13 declared fields, filed under Capital Projects & Scheduling, 0 foreign keys pointing at it. Its fields are documented even though the record is not: 12 of its 13 inventoried fields carry a definition written by the vendor. Open the field groups below and read them — that is the best account of this record available.

## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

### Lands in link_issue_part

**Observed.** The field inventory names the physical destination of every column: one table in the database lxr_drp_bbw. Every field node carries its own table and column, so the mapping is per column, not per record.

### A per-tenant database name

**Derived.** The physical database is lxr_drp_bbw — the tenant's name is in the database name. That is one more piece of evidence for database-per-tenant and against a single shared schema, alongside the Firm_ columns.

### 12 fields carry a vendor definition

**Observed.** 12 of this record's 13 inventoried fields have prose written by the vendor saying what the field is for. Open any field node to read it — this is the one source in the corpus that explains fields rather than listing them.

### 4 fields marked required

**Observed.** The inventory marks 4 of this record's fields Required. Across the whole inventory that is 606 fields, which independently corroborates the 603 the corpus had derived from the Data Fields catalogue — two sources, arrived at separately, agreeing to within three.

### Replication coverage: not materialised

**Observed.** Observed of the loader, not of the product. The replication target lxr_drp_bbw has never created a table for this record: Table may not exist in the database yet. No data has ever been returned for this Lx object, and the loader only issues CREATE TABLE once the first row arrives. The configuration is in place, so this table and all of its columns will be created automatically as soon as data is entered in Lx. That is a statement about one loader's coverage and says nothing about whether the record exists or holds data in Lx. The tell is ProjectEntity — 107 fields, every one marked extracted, table never created, yet it is the universal supertype of a tenant holding 2,014 contracts, so it plainly is not empty. Do not read the 69-created / 150-not-created split as the size of the product's schema.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [AST-R-014](../rules/AST-R-014.md) | Input: `LinkIssuePart.IssueID` + `.AssetID` (typed `Equipment ID`) + `.PartID` + `.Quantity` + `.CostPerPart` + `.TotalCost` + `.SerialNumber` — an object in the `projects-capital` module, not this one. Effect: The practical path from a `Wo | Derived |
| [PRJ-R-009](../rules/PRJ-R-009.md) | A part is consumed or ordered against a work-order `Issue` · `LinkIssuePart` (cost, labor hours, serial number) vs. `LinkIssuePartOrder` (quantity ordered/received, `CodePartOrderStatusID`) · Two distinct records — one for parts actually us | Observed |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (2)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetID` | Equipment | The ID of the asset associated with the issue. | Equipment ID | — | yes | `link_issue_part.AssetID · TEXT` | [Asset](Asset.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  |  | Entity ID | — |  | `link_issue_part.ProjectEntityID · TEXT` | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Soft references (1)

Columns that name another record without a typed foreign key behind them - generic handles such as Entity ID and item ID that point at whichever table the row belongs to. These are the joins a rebuild has to make explicit.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PartID` | Part Name | The ID of the part. | Part | — | yes | `link_issue_part.PartID · TEXT` |  |

### Money (2)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CostPerPart` | Part Cost | The unit cost of the part. | Currency | — |  | `link_issue_part.CostPerPart · TEXT` |  |
| `TotalCost` | Total Cost | Calculates the total cost of the order. | Currency | — |  | `link_issue_part.TotalCost · TEXT` |  |

### Quantities (3)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LinkIssuePartID` | Part RecID | This field contains a Base Entity System Identifier for your record. It is assigned automatically by the system, and is not editable. | Number | — |  | `link_issue_part.LinkIssuePartID · VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL` |  |
| `NumberHoursLabor` | Hours Labor | The number of labor hours. | Number | — |  | `link_issue_part.NumberHoursLabor · TEXT` |  |
| `Quantity` |  | The quantity of parts being ordered. | Number | — | yes | `link_issue_part.Quantity · TEXT` |  |

### Text & notes (3)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IssueID` | Issue | The ID of the form. | Text | — | yes | `link_issue_part.IssueID · TEXT` |  |
| `ModelNumber` | Part # Used | The model number of the part. | Text | — |  | `link_issue_part.ModelNumber · TEXT` |  |
| `SerialNumber` | Serial # | The serial number of the part. | Text | — |  | `link_issue_part.SerialNumber · TEXT` |  |

### Audit & record keeping (2)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | The Modified By field is a system-populated field which captures the name of the member who made a change to a record. | Member ID | — |  | `link_issue_part.ModifiedByID · TEXT` | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | The Modified Date field is a system-populated field which captures the date that a modification is made to a record. | Time | — |  | `link_issue_part.ModifiedDate · TEXT` |  |

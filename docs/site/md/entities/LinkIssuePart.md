*13 fields · module: Capital Projects & Scheduling · Postgres: `link_issue_part`*

Not covered by the Data Fields catalogue: this record type appears in the 223-object census but has no row in the catalogue of 6,158 configurable fields, so nothing in the corpus explains it in the vendor's own words. What is known is structural — 13 declared fields, filed under Capital Projects & Scheduling, 0 foreign keys pointing at it.

## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [AST-R-014](../rules/AST-R-014.md) | Input: `LinkIssuePart.IssueID` + `.AssetID` (typed `Equipment ID`) + `.PartID` + `.Quantity` + `.CostPerPart` + `.TotalCost` + `.SerialNumber` — an object in the `projects-capital` module, not this one. Effect: The practical path from a `Wo | Derived |
| [PRJ-R-009](../rules/PRJ-R-009.md) | A part is consumed or ordered against a work-order `Issue` · `LinkIssuePart` (cost, labor hours, serial number) vs. `LinkIssuePartOrder` (quantity ordered/received, `CodePartOrderStatusID`) · Two distinct records — one for parts actually us | Observed |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (2)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetID` |  | Equipment ID | — |  | [Asset](Asset.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  | Entity ID | — |  | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Soft references (1)

Columns that name another record without a typed foreign key behind them - generic handles such as Entity ID and item ID that point at whichever table the row belongs to. These are the joins a rebuild has to make explicit.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PartID` |  | Part | — |  |  |

### Money (2)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CostPerPart` |  | Currency | — |  |  |
| `TotalCost` |  | Currency | — |  |  |

### Quantities (3)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LinkIssuePartID` |  | Number | — |  |  |
| `NumberHoursLabor` |  | Number | — |  |  |
| `Quantity` |  | Number | — |  |  |

### Text & notes (3)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IssueID` |  | Text | — |  |  |
| `ModelNumber` |  | Text | — |  |  |
| `SerialNumber` |  | Text | — |  |  |

### Audit & record keeping (2)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ModifiedByID` |  | Member ID | — |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` |  | Time | — |  |  |

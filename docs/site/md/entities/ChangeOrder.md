## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

### Lands in change_order

**Observed.** The field inventory names the physical destination of every column: one table in the database lxr_drp_bbw. Every field node carries its own table and column, so the mapping is per column, not per record.

### A per-tenant database name

**Derived.** The physical database is lxr_drp_bbw — the tenant's name is in the database name. That is one more piece of evidence for database-per-tenant and against a single shared schema, alongside the Firm_ columns.

### 10 fields carry a vendor definition

**Observed.** 10 of this record's 16 inventoried fields have prose written by the vendor saying what the field is for. Open any field node to read it — this is the one source in the corpus that explains fields rather than listing them.

### 2 fields marked required

**Observed.** The inventory marks 2 of this record's fields Required. Across the whole inventory that is 606 fields, which independently corroborates the 603 the corpus had derived from the Data Fields catalogue — two sources, arrived at separately, agreeing to within three.

### Replication coverage: not materialised

**Observed.** Observed of the loader, not of the product. The replication target lxr_drp_bbw has never created a table for this record: Table may not exist in the database yet. No data has ever been returned for this Lx object, and the loader only issues CREATE TABLE once the first row arrives. The configuration is in place, so this table and all of its columns will be created automatically as soon as data is entered in Lx. That is a statement about one loader's coverage and says nothing about whether the record exists or holds data in Lx. The tell is ProjectEntity — 107 fields, every one marked extracted, table never created, yet it is the universal supertype of a tenant holding 2,014 contracts, so it plainly is not empty. Do not read the 69-created / 150-not-created split as the size of the product's schema.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (2)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ProjectEntityID` |  |  | Entity ID | — |  | `change_order.ProjectEntityID · TEXT` | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |
| `PurchaseOrderID` | Related Purchase Order | The ID of the purchase order. | Purchase Order ID | Global |  | `change_order.PurchaseOrderID · TEXT` | [PurchaseOrder](PurchaseOrder.md) |

### Money (3)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ApprovedChangeOrderAmount` | Approved Change Order Amount |  | Currency | Global |  | `change_order.ApprovedChangeOrderAmount · TEXT` |  |
| `CostTrackingVariance` | Cost Tracking Variance |  | Currency | Global |  | `change_order.CostTrackingVariance · TEXT` |  |
| `OutstandingChangeOrderAmount` | Outstanding Change Order Amount |  | Currency | Global |  | `change_order.OutstandingChangeOrderAmount · TEXT` |  |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ChangeOrderID` | Change Order RecID | The ID of the change order. | Number | Global |  | `change_order.ChangeOrderID · VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL` |  |

### Text & notes (4)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ChangeOrderSequenceNumber` | Change Order Sequence Number |  | Text | Global |  | `change_order.ChangeOrderSequenceNumber · TEXT` |  |
| `IssueID` | Change Order Issue | The ID of the form. | Text | Global | yes | `change_order.IssueID · TEXT` |  |
| `Notes` |  | Add any notes about the record. | Text | Global |  | `change_order.Notes · TEXT` |  |
| `VendorCONumber` | Vendor CO Number |  | Text | Global |  | `change_order.VendorCONumber · TEXT` |  |

### Audit & record keeping (6)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BOMapClientRecordID` | Change Order ClientID | The ClientID field is a free form text field that can be used when importing data to uniquely look up a record for update. This record identifier can either be system-generated or defined by the user upon the initial import of record data. The ClientID has the database name "BOMapClientRecordID". | Text | Global | yes | `change_order.BOMapClientRecordID · TEXT` |  |
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | The Created By field is a system-populated field which captures the name of the member making changes to a record. | Member ID | Global |  | `change_order.CreatedByID · TEXT` | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | The Created Date field is a system-populated field which captures the date that a record was created. | Time | Global |  | `change_order.CreatedDate · TEXT` |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | The Modified By field is a system-populated field which captures the name of the member who made a change to a record. | Member ID | Global |  | `change_order.ModifiedByID · TEXT` | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | The Modified Date field is a system-populated field which captures the date that a modification is made to a record. | Time | Global |  | `change_order.ModifiedDate · TEXT` |  |
| `RevNumber` | Rev Number | The Rev Number field indicates how many times a record has been modified. This value of the field increases by 1 each time the record is modified. | Number | Global |  | `change_order.RevNumber · TEXT` |  |

## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [CON-R-061](../rules/CON-R-061.md) | Offsets are applied: VariableRentOffset and ScheduledOffset, applied via APPLY_OFFSETS, reduce the rent-year obligation. | Observed |
| [CON-R-076](../rules/CON-R-076.md) | A ScheduledOffset is drawn down: a landlord credit (TotalAmount, CapAmountPerMonth) is drawn down over time against named expense group/types, via APPLY_OFFSETS. | Derived |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (2)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ContractID` | Contract | Contract ID | Global | yes | [Contract](Contract.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  | Entity ID | — |  | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (2)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeExpenseGroupID` | Expense Group | Dropdown (Expense Group Code) | Global |  | Expense Group Code |
| `CodeExpenseTypeID` | Expense Type | Dropdown (Expense Type Code) | Global |  | Expense Type Code |

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LinkSchedOffsetExpGrpTypeID` | Scheduled Offset Expense Type RecID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

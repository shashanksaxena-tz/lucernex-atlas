## What to know before rebuilding this

### Firm-global reference data

**Derived.** Owned by the firm as a whole rather than by any one business record — configuration and reference data rather than transactional rows.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [AST-R-014](../rules/AST-R-014.md) | Input: `LinkIssuePart.IssueID` + `.AssetID` (typed `Equipment ID`) + `.PartID` + `.Quantity` + `.CostPerPart` + `.TotalCost` + `.SerialNumber` — an object in the `projects-capital` module, not this one. Effect: The practical path from a `Wo | Derived |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (1)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `VendorID` | Vendor | Employer ID | Global |  | [Employer](Employer.md) |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PartPackageID` | Part Package RecID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

## What to know before rebuilding this

### A computed projection, not a table

**Observed.** Virtual records are calculated at read time rather than stored. They have no primary key to join on and never appear in Firm scope — a tenant cannot customise a projection the platform generates. Treat this as the shape of a query result, not as a table to migrate.

### Firm-global reference data

**Derived.** Owned by the firm as a whole rather than by any one business record — configuration and reference data rather than transactional rows.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (2)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ContractID` | Contract | Contract ID | Global |  | [Contract](Contract.md) |
| `ExpenseAccrualScheduleID` | Accrual Schedule | Expense Accrual Schedule ID | Global |  | [ExpenseAccrualSchedule](ExpenseAccrualSchedule.md) |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (4)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeAccrualTypeID` | Accrual Type | Dropdown (Accrual Type Code) | Global |  | Accrual Type Code |
| `CodeExpenseCategoryID` | Expense Category | Dropdown (Expense Category Code) | Global |  | Expense Category Code |
| `CodeExpenseGroupID` | Expense Group | Dropdown (Expense Group Code) | Global |  | Expense Group Code |
| `CodeExpenseTypeID` | Expense Type | Dropdown (Expense Type Code) | Global |  | Expense Type Code |

### Money (1)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PeriodExpense` | Period Amount | Currency | Global |  |  |

### Quantities (2)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Period` | Fiscal Period | Number | Global |  |  |
| `Year` | Fiscal Year | Number | Global |  |  |

### Dates & timestamps (2)

Dates that drive schedules, and system timestamps.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BeginDate` | Begin Date | Date | Global |  |  |
| `EndDate` | End Date | Date | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ExpenseAccrualSetupID` | Accrual Setup | Text | Global |  |  |

### Other (1)

Everything that did not fall into a named group.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DateRange` | Date Range | Date Range | Global |  |  |

## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (4)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetID` | Asset | Equipment ID | Global | yes | [Asset](Asset.md) |
| `ContractID` | Contract | Contract ID | Global | yes | [Contract](Contract.md) |
| `CovenantID` | Covenant | Covenant ID | Global |  | [Covenant](Covenant.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  | Entity ID | — |  | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Soft references (1)

Columns that name another record without a typed foreign key behind them - generic handles such as Entity ID and item ID that point at whichever table the row belongs to. These are the joins a rebuild has to make explicit.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetAssociatedProjectEntityID` | Asset Associated Entity | Entity | Global |  |  |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (2)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeAccountingAdjustmentTypeID` | Accounting Adjustment Type | Dropdown (Accounting Adjustment Type Code) | Global |  | Accounting Adjustment Type Code |
| `CodeFinancialAdjustmentStatusID` | Financial Adjustment Status | Dropdown (Financial Adjustment Status Code) | Global |  | Financial Adjustment Status Code |

### Money (3)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Amount` |  | Currency | Global |  |  |
| `ThirdPartyRVGAmount` | Portion Guaranteed By 3rd Party | Currency | Global |  |  |
| `TotalRVGAmount` | Total Residual Value Guarantee | Currency | Global |  |  |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FinancialAdjustmentID` | Financial Adjustment RecID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Dates & timestamps (1)

Dates that drive schedules, and system timestamps.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EffectiveDate` | Effective Date | Date | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Notes` |  | Text | Global |  |  |

### Audit & record keeping (6)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BOMapClientRecordID` | Financial Adjustment ClientID | Text | Global | yes |  |
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `RevNumber` | Rev Number | Number | Global |  |  |

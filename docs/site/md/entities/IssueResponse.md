## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (1)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ProjectEntityID` | ProjectEntity ID | Entity ID | Global | yes | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IssueResponseID` | Issue Response ID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (4)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Body` |  | Text | Global |  |  |
| `IssueID` | Issue ID | Text | Global | yes |  |
| `SequenceNumber` | Sequence Number | Text | Global | yes |  |
| `Subject` |  | Text | Global | yes |  |

### Audit & record keeping (5)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `RevNumber` | Rev Number | Number | Global |  |  |

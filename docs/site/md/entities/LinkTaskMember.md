## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [PRJ-R-011](../rules/PRJ-R-011.md) | A task needs a named assignee · `LinkTaskMember.MemberID` · Assigns a specific `Member`, alongside `TaskGroup.Assignee_MemberID`'s own direct field — two mechanisms for the same concept exist side by side. · Observed | Observed |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (3)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MemberID` | Member | Member ID | Global | yes | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` | Project Entity | Entity ID | Global | yes | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |
| `TaskID` | Task | Task/Group ID | Global | yes | [TaskGroup](TaskGroup.md) |

| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | Time | Global |  |  |

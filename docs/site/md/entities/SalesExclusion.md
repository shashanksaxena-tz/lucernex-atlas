## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [CON-R-052](../rules/CON-R-052.md) | An exclusion applies: rawExcluded = salesOfType × SalesExclusion.ExclusionRate. | Derived |
| [CON-R-053](../rules/CON-R-053.md) | Exclusions share a cap group (ExclusionGroupCapID): PRPGrossExcludedAmount sums the raw excluded amounts within the group, before the cap. | Derived |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (3)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ContractID` | Contract | Contract ID | Global | yes | [Contract](Contract.md) |
| `ExclusionGroupCapID` | Exclusion Group Cap | Sales Exclusion Cap ID | Global |  | [SalesExclusionCap](SalesExclusionCap.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  | Entity ID | — |  | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (3)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeCurrencyTypeID` | Currency Type | Dropdown (Currency Type Code) | Global |  | Currency Type Code |
| `CodeSalesGroupID` | Sales Group | Dropdown (Sales Group) | Global |  | Sales Group |
| `CodeSalesTypeID` | Sales Type | Dropdown (Sales Type) | Global |  | Sales Type |

### Money (1)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Rates & percentages (2)

Percentage inputs and computed rates.

### Text & notes (1)

### Audit & record keeping (6)

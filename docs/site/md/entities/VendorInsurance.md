## What to know before rebuilding this

### Firm-global reference data

**Derived.** Owned by the firm as a whole rather than by any one business record — configuration and reference data rather than transactional rows.

### Lands in vendor_insurance

**Observed.** The field inventory names the physical destination of every column: one table in the database lxr_drp_bbw. Every field node carries its own table and column, so the mapping is per column, not per record.

### A per-tenant database name

**Derived.** The physical database is lxr_drp_bbw — the tenant's name is in the database name. That is one more piece of evidence for database-per-tenant and against a single shared schema, alongside the Firm_ columns.

### 15 fields carry a vendor definition

**Observed.** 15 of this record's 15 inventoried fields have prose written by the vendor saying what the field is for. Open any field node to read it — this is the one source in the corpus that explains fields rather than listing them.

### 2 fields marked required

**Observed.** The inventory marks 2 of this record's fields Required. Across the whole inventory that is 606 fields, which independently corroborates the 603 the corpus had derived from the Data Fields catalogue — two sources, arrived at separately, agreeing to within three.

### Replication coverage: not materialised

**Observed.** Observed of the loader, not of the product. The replication target lxr_drp_bbw has never created a table for this record: Table may not exist in the database yet. No data has ever been returned for this Lx object, and the loader only issues CREATE TABLE once the first row arrives. The configuration is in place, so this table and all of its columns will be created automatically as soon as data is entered in Lx. That is a statement about one loader's coverage and says nothing about whether the record exists or holds data in Lx. The tell is ProjectEntity — 107 fields, every one marked extracted, table never created, yet it is the universal supertype of a tenant holding 2,014 contracts, so it plainly is not empty. Do not read the 69-created / 150-not-created split as the size of the product's schema.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (1)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `VendorID` | Vendor | The ID of the vendor associated with the policy. | Employer ID | Global | yes | `vendor_insurance.VendorID · TEXT` | [Employer](Employer.md) |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (1)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeInsurancePolicyTypeID` | Insurance Policy Type | Select the insurance policy type from this field. | Dropdown (Insurance Policy Type Code) | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.CodeInsurancePolicyTypeID · TEXT` | Insurance Policy Type Code |

### Money (2)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AggregateOccurrenceAmt` | Aggregate Occurrence Amt | Enter the aggregate occurrence amount the vendor's policy covers in this field. | Currency | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.AggregateOccurrenceAmt · TEXT` |  |
| `SingleOccurrenceAmt` | Single Occurrence Amt | Enter the single occurrence amount the vendor's policy covers in this field. | Currency | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.SingleOccurrenceAmt · TEXT` |  |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `VendorInsuranceID` | Vendor Insurance RecID | This field contains a Base Entity System Identifier for your record. It is assigned automatically by the system, and is not editable. | Number | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.VendorInsuranceID · VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL` |  |

### Dates & timestamps (3)

Dates that drive schedules, and system timestamps.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BeginDate` | Begin Date | The Begin Date field allows you to select a begin date for the record. | Date | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.BeginDate · TEXT` |  |
| `EndDate` | End Date | The End Date field allows you to select an end date for the record. | Date | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.EndDate · TEXT` |  |
| `VerifiedDate` | Verified Date | This field is used to store the date the vendor insurance record was verified. | Date | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.VerifiedDate · TEXT` |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Policy` |  | Enter details about the vendor's insurance policy in this field. | Text | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.Policy · TEXT` |  |

### Audit & record keeping (6)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | What it is for | Declared type | Scope | Req | Physical column | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BOMapClientRecordID` | Vendor Insurance ClientID | The ClientID field is a free form text field that can be used when importing data to uniquely look up a record for update. This record identifier can either be system-generated or defined by the user upon the initial import of record data. The ClientID has the database name "BOMapClientRecordID". | Text | Global | yes | `vendor_insurance.BOMapClientRecordID · TEXT` |  |
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | The Created By field is a system-populated field which captures the name of the member making changes to a record. | Member ID | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.CreatedByID · TEXT` | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | The Created Date field is a system-populated field which captures the date that a record was created. | Time | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.CreatedDate · TEXT` |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | The Modified By field is a system-populated field which captures the name of the member who made a change to a record. | Member ID | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.ModifiedByID · TEXT` | [Member](Member.md) |

| `RevNumber` | Rev Number | The Rev Number field indicates how many times a record has been modified. This value of the field increases by 1 each time the record is modified. | Number | Global |  | `vendor_insurance.RevNumber · TEXT` |  |

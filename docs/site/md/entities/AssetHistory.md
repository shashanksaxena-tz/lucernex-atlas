## What to know before rebuilding this

### Firm-global reference data

**Derived.** Owned by the firm as a whole rather than by any one business record — configuration and reference data rather than transactional rows.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [AST-R-016](../rules/AST-R-016.md) | Input: `AssetHistory.ProjectEntityID` and `.FromProjectEntityID`, both typed the soft `Entity` type rather than the hard `Entity ID` type. Effect: The object behaves as an entity-scoped snapshot of an `Asset`'s state, but escapes the mechan | Derived |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (1)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetID` | Asset | Equipment ID | Global | yes | [Asset](Asset.md) |

### Soft references (2)

Columns that name another record without a typed foreign key behind them - generic handles such as Entity ID and item ID that point at whichever table the row belongs to. These are the joins a rebuild has to make explicit.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FromProjectEntityID` | From Entity | Entity | Global |  |  |
| `ProjectEntityID` | To Entity | Entity | Global | yes |  |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AssetHistoryID` | Asset History RecID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Dates & timestamps (2)

Dates that drive schedules, and system timestamps.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MoveInDate` | Move In Date | Date | Global |  |  |
| `MoveOutDate` | Move Out Date | Date | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Notes` |  | Text | Global |  |  |

### Audit & record keeping (6)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BOMapClientRecordID` | Asset History ClientID | Text | Global | yes |  |
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `ModifiedDate` | Modified Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `RevNumber` | Rev Number | Number | Global |  |  |

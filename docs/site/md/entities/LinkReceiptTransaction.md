## What to know before rebuilding this

### Tenant-scoped, one join deep

**Derived.** This record carries no FirmID of its own. It hangs off ProjectEntity, and tenant isolation has to be enforced by joining to that row and filtering on its FirmID — or it is not enforced at all. 161 of the 223 record types are shaped this way.

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (3)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PaymentReceiptID` | Payment Receipt | Payment Receipt ID | Global | yes | [PaymentReceipt](PaymentReceipt.md) |
| `PaymentTransactionID` | Payment Transaction | Payment Transaction ID | Global | yes | [PaymentTransaction](PaymentTransaction.md) |
| `ProjectEntityID` |  | Entity ID | — |  | [ProjectEntity](ProjectEntity.md) |

### Money (1)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AllocationAmount` | Allocation Amount | Currency | Global |  |  |

### Quantities (1)

Counts, areas and other plain numeric measures.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LinkReceiptTransactionID` | Link Receipt Transaction RecID | Number | Global |  |  |

### Text & notes (1)

Free text. Notably, free text is never allowed to drive a conditional display rule.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Notes` |  | Text | Global |  |  |

### Audit & record keeping (6)

Who created and changed the record, and the identifiers that survive migration.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BOMapClientRecordID` | Link Receipt Transaction ClientID | Text | Global | yes |  |
| `CreatedByID` | Created By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |
| `CreatedDate` | Created Date | Time | Global |  |  |
| `ModifiedByID` | Modified By | Member ID | Global |  | [Member](Member.md) |

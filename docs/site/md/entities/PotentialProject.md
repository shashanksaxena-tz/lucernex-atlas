# PotentialProject

*108 fields · module: Portfolio & Real-Estate Transactions · Postgres: `potential_project`*

Not covered by the Data Fields catalogue: this record type appears in the 223-object census but has no row in the catalogue of 6,158 configurable fields, so nothing in the corpus explains it in the vendor's own words. What is known is structural — 108 declared fields, filed under Portfolio & Real-Estate Transactions, 0 foreign keys pointing at it.

## What to know before rebuilding this

### 6 tenant custom columns

**Observed.** This record carries 6 physical Firm_-prefixed columns — tenant custom fields are real columns, not rows in a value store, so adding one is a DDL change. That is direct evidence for database-per-tenant and against a shared schema.

### A ProjectEntity subtype root

**Derived.** One of the nine records that are themselves a kind of ProjectEntity rather than hanging off one. The discriminator is ProjectEntityTypeName, which is how a single table serves several apparent record types.

## Rules that govern it

| Rule | What it requires | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| [FAC-R-018](../rules/FAC-R-018.md) | Input: `Ownership`, `SiteSurvey`, `LandPurchaseSummary`, `LinkLandPurchaseInspection`, `DemographicResults` carry `ProjectEntityID` and no hard-typed FK to `Facility`/`Location`/`Parcel`. Effect: In principle any of these can attach to any  | Derived |
| [POR-R-005](../rules/POR-R-005.md) | A `PotentialProject`, `Program`, `Scenario`, or `RETransaction` needs a deal classification · `PotentialProject.CodeDealTypeID` / `Program.CodeDealTypeID` → `Deal Type Code` (2024); `Scenario.CodeScenarioDealTypeID` / `RETransaction.Preferr | Observed |
| [POR-R-007](../rules/POR-R-007.md) | A rollout program needs capacity tracking · `DevelopmentPlan` → `DevelopmentSlot` → `ProgramRevenueWeeks` · Rolls up filled/unfilled slot and week counts per `Program`. No FK connects a `DevelopmentSlot` to the specific `PotentialProject`/` | Derived |
| [POR-R-011](../rules/POR-R-011.md) | Any process needs to trace a `Facility`/`Location` back to the `PotentialProject` it originated from · (none — no such column exists) · Not possible via FK. `PotentialProject` has zero inbound edges in the 972-edge graph and zero Manage Dat | Observed |

## Fields

### Relationships (foreign keys) (11)

Typed pointers to other records. Lx names each FK type after the table it points at, so the relational model is declared rather than implied.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BudgetTemplateID` |  | Template ID | — |  | [BudgetTemplate](BudgetTemplate.md) |
| `ComplexID` |  | Complex ID | — |  | [Complex](Complex.md) |
| `DemographicDMAID` |  | DMA ID | — |  | [DMA](DMA.md) |
| `IStateProvinceCountryID` |  | Country, State, County ID | — |  | [StateProvinceCountry](StateProvinceCountry.md) |
| `JurisdictionID` |  | County ID | — |  | [Jurisdiction](Jurisdiction.md) |
| `LocationID` |  | Location ID | — |  | [Location](Location.md) |
| `ProgramID` |  | Portfolio ID | — |  | [Program](Program.md) |
| `PrototypeID` |  | Prototype ID | — |  | [Prototype](Prototype.md) |

| `RootRegionID` |  | Region ID | — |  | [Region](Region.md) |
| `SubRegionID` |  | Region ID | — |  | [Region](Region.md) |

### Soft references (2)

Columns that name another record without a typed foreign key behind them - generic handles such as Entity ID and item ID that point at whichever table the row belongs to. These are the joins a rebuild has to make explicit.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LinkProjectEntityContactListData` |  | Contact | — |  |  |
| `ManagerIDList` |  | Dropdown | — |  |  |

### Coded values (drop-downs) (11)

Fields bound to a master code table. Every one of these is a place where an administrator, not a developer, controls the allowed values.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CodeBuildingAreaUnitID` |  | Dropdown (Building Area Unit Code) | — |  | Building Area Unit Code |

| `CodeMarketTypeID` |  | Dropdown (Market Type Code) | — |  | Market Type Code |
| `CodeProjectTypeID` |  | Dropdown (Project Type Code) | — |  | Project Type Code |
| `CurrentCodeProjectPhaseID` |  | Dropdown (Project Phase Code) | — |  | Project Phase Code |

### Money (1)

Currency amounts. Stored as TEXT in the physical database, which is why the rebuild must impose BigDecimal typing of its own.

| Field | Label | Declared type | Scope | Req | Points at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Firm_PriorMonthAccrualTotal` |  | Currency | — |  |  |

### Quantities (14)
